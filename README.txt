OVERVIEW : GIFT GENERATOR

I am going to make a gift generator based on a few simple questions. 

Assisted: This will be the order form part. Generating a gift request based on a users input about age and sex of the recipient. 

Unassisted: I will then add another layer where the generator will show different gift options based on what the user input was.

EPIC: Create a gift idea generator.

User Story: User wants to buy an appropriate gift based on age and gender.
User Story: User wants more than one option.

(*) Gather all design elements (fonts, images etc) & make sure they are formated, names and filed correctly.
(*) Create file structure.
(*) Write basic HTML structure.
(*) Write basic CSS. 
(*) Define variables (Age, Sex)
(*) Write function that will display the chosen values within a request.
(*) Call function to display outcome on event (click)
(*) write Else If Statement for every possible outcome/variable value combinations
(*) Link the appropriate images based on the conditions
(*) The same event will trigger the images to appear

Planning for assisted: 
- I plan on using the sandwich builder and modifying it to suit my needs.

Planning for unassisted: 
- I want to use an "else if statement" to display the right pictures linked to the var values chosen by the user.
